    <h2 style="text-align: center;">About HackersFriend Certificate</h2>
<h3>What is HackersFriend certificate ?</h3>
<p>HackersFriend certificate is a document issued by HackersFriend to any individual after conducting a test in front of HackersFriend representatives. This document is used by candidates to show their skills while applying for any job or anywhere.</p>
<h3>How does anyone gets this certificate ?</h3>
<p>HackersFriend organizes a test of the required field before certifying anyone. Candidate has to score at least 60% in the test. Only then, they get this certificate. These tests are organized in front of HackersFriend representatives at any alloted center or during workshop not at candidate's home.</p>
<h3>Is this certificate, certifies the candidate's ability work for any position in industry in given field ?</h3>
<p>We don't believe in tradition of certificates for verifying anyone's ability. We believe in building things. Thats why we've designed our tests in such a way that, candidate's are required to build something unique by using that skill in a given amount of time. So, when we say anyone is certified by us in any field, what we mean to say is, he/she is has built something in front of using that technology. So, yes if someone is certified by us, he/she can work anywhere in that field. </p>
<h3>Can I use this certificate to show my skill on my resume?</h3>
<p>Yes you can. Added advantage is whatever you've built or scored will be available on certificate and same can be verified online from anywhere anytime. <a href="verify.html">Click here to verify any certificate.</a></p>
<h3>I work in an Industry, i want to switch to different project that requires a different skill, i need to show my skill's certificate, can i use this certificate ?</h3>
<p>Of course you can. When you certified you, we've already putted you through whatever anyone needs to know to start working with that technology. So, if you're certified you can show your certificate wherever you need to.</p>
<h3>How can i verify genuinity of my certificate, i.e. it is issued by HackersFriend ?</h3>
<p>You can verify genuinity of any certificate from <a href="verify.html"> here.</a></p>
